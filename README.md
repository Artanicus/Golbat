# Golbat

Golbat is an experimental raw data processor for Pokemon Go.
Initially designed to be database compatible with RDM, it will
be able to evolve faster by not needing to retain backward
compatibility 

# Requirements

`go 1.18`

You may have problems installing this, let me know.
I used ubuntu 22 (jimmy) and could do `sudo apt install golang-go` but earlier
versions of ubuntu have an older package

# Instructions

1. copy `config.json.example` to `config.json`
2. `go run .`
